# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer
- Sorting algorithms visualizer program for the following sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, shell sort, heap sort, quick sort, and merge sort. The program sorts an array of integers and in real time displays a visual representation of the sorting process using rectangular bars, where the height of each bar corresponds to the integers in the array. The code was written so that each sorting algorithm takes about 25 seconds to complete thus giving a good visual representation of the sorting process.
- The project was done using C++, SFML 2.5.1, and also requires the use of a Linux library.

# Instructions
- The program expects two command line arguments after the executable: **./SortingAlgorithmsVisualizer [sorting-algorithm-name] sort**. 
- Selection sort as an example: **./SortingAlgorithmsVisualizer selection sort**.
